First install dependencies for `dev` environment by `pip install -e .[dev]`

Suggest install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/) for `tox` to test against multiple environment. On Mac, install via [Home Brew](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#homebrew-on-macos) by `brew install pyenv`, and then install more test environment by [`pyenv install 3.5.0`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md#pyenv-install).
